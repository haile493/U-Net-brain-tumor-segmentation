# Brain tumor segmentation using U-Net architecture

### About the method
We applied U-Net architecture to train BRATS 2013 dataset using 3 scanning images: FLAIR, T1c and T2 as proved by Xiaomei Zhao et al., ["A deep learning integrating FCNN's and CRFs for brain tumor segmentation"](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1702/1702.04528.pdf).

We used many types of U-Net architecture from many resources as commented in "BRATs_unet_2.py"

We also applied Data augmentation using [tensorlayer](https://github.com/zsdonghao/tensorlayer) library and from [zsdonghao github](https://github.com/zsdonghao/u-net-brain-tumor) based on [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.03820.pdf)
